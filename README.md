# Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_mode_decomposition

This repository is my sandbox for experimenting with DMD.

1. Working on a streaming (incremental) DMD algorithm

2. Experimenting with the pydmd package (very well done!) and possibly
implementing a sliding window approach to compare with an incremental
approach.
